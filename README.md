# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create a single data set.
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
